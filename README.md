Each financial transaction requires authorization from the Bank System.

On successful completion, Update Balance and Print Receipt use cases are included.

Non-Financial Services

Maintenance & Admin Control

Technicians ensure the ATM remains functional through cash refill and hardware/software diagnostics.
